📊 Analyzing Amazon Electronics Sales Data with Python

This project explores online electronics sales on Amazon to uncover customer behavior, sales patterns, and product performance. By using Python and popular data-analysis libraries, the project delivers insights that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

🛠️ Tools & Tech Stack Used
🔧 Programming Language

Python – Foundation for data analysis, cleaning, manipulation, and visualisation.

📚 Libraries

Pandas – For data loading, preprocessing, cleaning, and tabular analysis.

NumPy – For numerical operations and optimized computations.

Matplotlib – For static data visualizations (bar charts, line plots, histograms).

Seaborn – For advanced, attractive statistical visualizations.

📂 Dataset

Public dataset from Kaggle: Electronics Sales Data – Amazon Marketplace
(Contains product details, pricing, ratings, reviews, and sales-related attributes.)

❗ Problem Statement

Online marketplaces like Amazon host millions of products, making it difficult to manually understand:

Which electronics products perform well 💡

What pricing patterns attract more customers 💰

How ratings/reviews affect sales ⭐

What trends exist across categories, brands, and price ranges 📈

Businesses require clear insights to optimize listings, boost conversions, and understand customer preferences.

✅ Solution Overview

This project uses data analysis techniques to extract actionable insights from Amazon electronics data.

🔍 1. Data Loading & Preparation

Importing libraries

Loading the dataset

Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types

Normalizing text fields (product names, categories)

📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed deep dive into:

⭐ Product rating distribution

💵 Price variability across categories

📦 Best-selling product types

🔝 Top brands by sales indicators

📈 Trends in review count vs rating

🧮 Correlation between price, rating, reviews, and sales

Used visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, histograms) to clearly present patterns.

📥 3. Insights Extracted

Some typical insights include:

Lower-priced items often gain higher sales volume

Categories like headphones, mobile accessories dominate sales

Higher ratings usually correlate with more reviews → trust factor
